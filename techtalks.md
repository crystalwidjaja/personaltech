* Programs are a combination of algorithms and data structures
* Paradigm: Approach or a methodology or a strategy to be followed for writing software applications
* Imperative Programming: Programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state
* Object Oriented Programming: Programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects

* Head refers to the front of the queue, tail refers to the end of the queue
* Heads and Tails change based on how many objects are in queue
* Building a stack reverses the order of a queue
* Circular refer to the first in first out idea, so that the queue links up in a ring

# Week 2

* Uses reverse polish notation which separates out operations from numbers and rearranges them
* Integers get turned into tokens (seem to be similar to objects) which are then moved around because of the reverse polish notation
* Need to use different testers (drivers) that simulate possible expressions 
* Define operators and create tokenizer
